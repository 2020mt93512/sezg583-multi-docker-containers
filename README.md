# SEZG583 Scalable Services Assignment 1

## Running multiple microservices each in individual docker containers

This project contains scripts that are used to build the artifacts for the 3 microservices developed as part of Assignment 1 and create a single docker image for each microservice. These images will then be run in the separate containers.

This is done using the help of `docker-compose`. A `docker-compose.yml` file is written to help create the multi-container setup by declaring each image to be run in a separate container as a `service`, and exposing the required services to each other using the `hostname` property. This `hostname` is essential for other containers within the docker-compose network to locate each other.

We also utilise other properties like `environment` to setup expected environment variables, `ports` to indicate to the network the host:container port mapping and `depends_on` to ensure that each service that depends on another service is built only after all the services it depends on are setup and running.

To deploy the services in individual containers, the following commands are used:
- To build the artifacts (you need to have Java 8)
	```bash
	./clone-repo-step.sh
	./build-jars-step.sh
	```
- To build the docker images (run from root of each multi-docker-containers repo, you need to have docker/docker desktop installed)
	```bash
	./create-docker-images
	```
- To create the docker containers and run them using docker-compose (you need to have docker/docker desktop installed)
	```bash
	docker-compose up
	```
- To bring down the containers used as part of the docker-compose
	```bash
	docker-compose down
	```

Below are few other helper docker commands used:
- To view the built docker images
	```bash
	docker image ls
	```
- To delete a docker image
	```bash
	docker image rm sezg583-assignment-single-container
	```
- To view running docker containers
	```bash
	docker ps
	```
- To stop a docker container
	```bash
	docker stop <container_id>
	```
- To stop a docker container
	```bash
	docker stop <container_id>
	```
- To remove a docker container
	```bash
	docker rm <container_id>
	```
